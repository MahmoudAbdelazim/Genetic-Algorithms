# Genetic-Algorithms
This repository contains all my implementation solutions for the Genetic algorithms course in college.

## Content:

### [Assignment 1 - Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Genetic-Algorithms/tree/main/Assignment%201%20-%20Genetic%20Programming)

A genetic algorithms solution for the known knapsack problem where we're trying to put
the maximum possible valued items into the knapsack


### [Assignment 2 - Smooth Curve Fitting](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Genetic-Algorithms/tree/main/Assignment%202%20-%20Genetic%20Algorithms)

A genetic algorithms solution for the smooth curve fitting problem where we're trying to 
get the best coefficients for a polynomial function to maximally fit all the points of the input.


### [Assignment 3 -Fuzzy Logic - Support System For Project Team Formation](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Genetic-Algorithms/tree/main/Assignment%203%20-%20Fuzzy%20Logic)

A fuzzy logic system for predicting the risk of a certain team formation based on the project fund and 
the experience level.
